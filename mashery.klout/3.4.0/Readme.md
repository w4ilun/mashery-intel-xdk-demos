SYNOPSIS
==================================================================
This demo App provides a way to see the Klout API in action. 
It's built using Intel's Cross Platform Development Kit (XDK) 
that lets you create mobile apps for smartphones and tablets using
standard web languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript).



FEATURES
==================================================================
Uses Klout's API to find Klout score based on your Twitter handle.



GETTING STARTED
==================================================================
You will need the following to get started -

1. Intel's XDK. Free Download - http://xdk-software.intel.com/
2. A Klout API key (Register at http://developer.Klout.com/member/register).



OBTAINING THE API KEY
==================================================================
Before you can begin using this app, you will need to get an API key 
from Klout at http://developer.Klout.com/member/register. This will also 
give you a Single Sign-On Mashery ID with access to hundreds of other APIs.


SETTING UP THE API KEY IN THIS APP
==================================================================
Once you have obtained your API key, assign the API key to the 
variable api_key on line 1 of the file Klout.js, like so -

<pre>
	var api_key ='your_api_key_here';
</pre>

ABOUT THE KLOUT API
==================================================================

Klout API allows developers access to the following information -

1. Klout Score - The Klout Score is the measurement of your overall online influence. The scores range from 1-100 with higher scores representing a wider and stronger sphere of influence.
2. Network Influence - Network Influence is the influence level of your engaged audience. Capturing the attention of influencers is no easy task, and those who are able to do so are typically creating spectacular content.
3. Amplification Probability -  Amplification Probability is the likelihood that your content will be acted upon. The ability to create content that compels others to respond and high-velocity content that spreads into networks beyond your own is a key component of influence.
4. True Reach - True Reach is the size of your engaged audience. We eliminate inactive and spam accounts, and only include accounts that you influence.
5. Influential About - The topics you are most influential about based not on what you talk about the most but on the subjects you get the most engagement on. 
6. Influencer Of/Influenced By: These are the people who you influence and who you are influenced by based on social actions.
